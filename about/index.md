I'm an open source fan, user, contributor.
I was contributed some works to several open source projects during I was
working for Intel, the one I contributed most is
[DBus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/ "dbus"), as honored as a
**committer**.

Currently I'm interested in cloud computing, especially elastic computing.

Be interested in [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/ "mesos") and computing
frameworks on-top of it, such like:

- [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/ "hadoop")
- [Apache Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/ "storm")
- [Airbnb Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos "chronos")
- ...

Not only target to a more effective data center for big data computing but also
for elastic service. Yes, based on [Docker](https://docker.com/ "docker").

I am also attracted by [openstack](http://www.openstack.org/ "openstack") and
willing to know more about it.
